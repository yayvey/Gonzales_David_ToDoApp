# Multimedia Authoring - To-Do App Build - David Gonzales

## Assignment Description
Use the in-class ToDo list as your starting point. Use generic selectors to add some style /
visual updates to the page.
Follow the steps listed below to add functionality with CSS, selectors and the ::before and
::after pseudo selectors. Use the reference links provided in the Week 11 module..
Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as
demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.

## Assignment Requirements
Follow the steps described below to update the ToDo list using CSS.
1. I added an image of a dog wasting time, and themed my to-do app around this dog wasting time.
2. The header I added was a calligrapher.ai svg of "Stop wasting your time, dog!"
3. I love the look of black and white, so I changed the colours/style to be more minimalistic so I can focus on the dog wasting time.
4. I added an input element with a type of checkbox to each “in progress” and each “done”
list item in the “in progress” and “done” lists.
5. I made it so all checkboxes respond independently, and with a "checked" color based on which category they are in.
7. I used the ::after styling to include a thumbs up emoji after the list item is checked.

## Site Requirements
This site will be built using HTML and CSS. You don't need any servers or asset compiling systems! Just download the code and get to work. :)
